# Upload simulator 2 generator calculator
*NOTICE: This is my first program written in C++.*
Program which given list of generators and max available space (in gen_consts.cpp file) will calculate optimal power multiplier setup

## TODO:
* Add CLI to set max space and max heat
* Maybe adding CLI or reading from file for generators list
* Making combinations list more readable
